 * - A backtracking Sudoku solver.
 * - A cell validation function to ensure valid number placement.
 * - A board generation stub for creating Sudoku puzzles.
 *
 * All functions operate on dynamically allocated 9x9 Sudoku boards
 * represented as `int**`, where empty cells are denoted by 0.

 * 
 * The function:
 * 1. Scans the entire board for empty cells (value == 0)
 * 2. For each empty cell, counts how many valid numbers (1-9) can be placed
 * 3. Tracks the cell with the minimum number of valid options
 * 4. Returns immediately if a cell with only one valid option is found

/**
 * @brief Efficiently solves a Sudoku board using the Minimum Remaining Value (MRV) heuristic.
 * 
 * This function implements an optimized Sudoku solving algorithm that uses the MRV heuristic
 * to reduce the branching factor in the backtracking search. Instead of filling cells in a
 * fixed order (row by row, column by column), it selects the empty cell with the fewest
 * valid number options at each step.
 * 
 * The MRV heuristic significantly improves performance by:
 * 1. Reducing the number of backtracks needed to find a solution
 * 2. Prioritizing cells with fewer options, which are more likely to lead to a solution
 * 3. Providing early exit opportunities when cells with only one valid option are found
 * 
 * The function uses recursive backtracking with the following steps:
 * 1. Find the next cell to fill using the MRV heuristic via findNextCell()
 * 2. If no empty cells remain, the board is solved
 * 3. Try placing numbers 1-9 in the selected cell
 * 4. For each valid number, recursively attempt to solve the rest of the board
 * 5. If a solution is found, return true
 * 6. If no solution is found, backtrack by removing the number and try the next option
 * 7. If no valid number works, return false to trigger further backtracking
 * 
 * @param BOARD A pointer to the 9x9 Sudoku board to be solved
 * @return true if the board is successfully solved, false otherwise
